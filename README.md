# Intelligent Customer Support Chatbot with GPT and RNN Context Management

## Overview

This project focuses on building an intelligent, real-time customer support chatbot that uses **multimodal text input** to provide accurate, context-aware responses for enhanced customer experience. The chatbot leverages:

- **GPT-3 or GPT-4**: For natural language understanding and generation, creating coherent, context-sensitive conversations.
- **Recurrent Neural Network (RNN)**: To maintain the conversation context over longer durations, ensuring responses are personalized based on previous interactions.
- **Flask API**: To make the chatbot accessible as a web service.
- **Cloud Deployment**: To provide a scalable, reliable customer support solution.

The chatbot is designed to handle dynamic user inquiries, generate personalized responses, and remember context over multiple conversational turns, making it ideal for applications in customer support automation.

## Motivation

Customer support is a critical component of modern business. While automation can improve efficiency and scalability, current support solutions often struggle to handle complex, multi-turn conversations in a context-sensitive manner. This project aims to bridge this gap by utilizing advanced NLP models combined with temporal memory (RNN) to offer personalized, interactive support services.

## Project Features

- **Context-Aware Dialogue**: Maintains the flow of a conversation using **RNN** to track previous interactions, providing personalized responses to users.
- **Real-Time Response**: Optimized for **low latency** to ensure real-time, interactive conversations with users.
- **Scalable Deployment**: Using **Docker** and **Kubernetes** to allow the chatbot to scale efficiently for large numbers of customer queries.
- **Natural Language Understanding**: **GPT-3/4** provides fluent and contextually appropriate responses, making conversations feel natural and human-like.
- **Ease of Use**: A web-based **API** is available for easy integration into existing customer support workflows.

## Project Architecture

The project architecture consists of several main components:

1. **Data Preprocessing**: 
   - Preprocessing customer support transcripts, cleaning, and tokenizing text.
   - Extracting features using **BERT embeddings** for better understanding by GPT.

2. **RNN for Context Tracking**:
   - An **LSTM/GRU-based RNN** is used to retain conversation history, which helps in keeping track of what the user has asked previously, thus providing context-aware responses.

3. **GPT-3/4 for Response Generation**:
   - Using **GPT** from HuggingFace's `transformers` library to generate responses based on user input and the contextual information provided by the RNN.

4. **Flask API for Chatbot Deployment**:
   - **Flask** is used to build a RESTful API, exposing the chatbot functionality for easy access and integration into different platforms.

5. **Deployment & Scalability**:
   - The application is **Dockerized** and deployed on **Kubernetes** for scalability.
   - **Ngrok** is used during development to expose the local server for testing.

## Technologies Used

- **Transformers (HuggingFace)**: To load and fine-tune **GPT-2/GPT-3/GPT-4** for generating responses.
- **TensorFlow/Keras**: For building and training the **RNN** model to handle the conversation context.
- **Flask** and **Flask-Ngrok**: To create the API and expose it for public access during testing.
- **Docker & Kubernetes**: For containerization and orchestration, ensuring the chatbot can scale based on user demand.
- **PySpark**: For parallel processing of customer inquiries, improving the speed of data processing.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project includes customer support transcripts covering typical inquiries such as order tracking, return policies, and payment methods. Data is cleaned, tokenized, and then embedded using **BERT** embeddings to improve understanding. Each query-response pair is processed to train the RNN and GPT models, allowing the chatbot to handle diverse customer queries and maintain context over multiple conversation turns.

## Methodology

### Data Preprocessing

- **Text Cleaning and Tokenization**: The raw text data is cleaned, removing special characters, and tokenized using `transformers` tokenizer to prepare it for GPT-3/4 input.
- **Feature Extraction**: Features are extracted from the input text using **BERT** to create a rich set of embeddings for effective input to GPT and RNN models.

### Context Handling with RNN

- **RNN Architecture**: The RNN is built using **LSTM** or **GRU** to remember the context of the conversation. This ensures that even multi-turn conversations remain consistent and meaningful.
- **Training**: The RNN model is trained on preprocessed support conversations to predict the next state in a conversation, enabling it to generate context for the GPT model.

### Response Generation with GPT-3/4

- **GPT-3/4** generates natural language responses based on user input and context provided by the RNN. It is fine-tuned on the customer support dataset to provide domain-specific responses.

### Deployment

- **API Deployment**: A **Flask** REST API is created to expose the chatbot. It accepts user input, processes the conversation context with the RNN, and generates responses using GPT.
- **Scalability**: The API is **Dockerized** for containerization, making it easy to scale. **Kubernetes** is used for orchestration, enabling efficient handling of high traffic.

## Model Performance

### RNN Context Management

- The **RNN** was able to successfully track context over multiple turns, providing input to GPT that enabled meaningful follow-ups.
- **Training Metrics**: The RNN model reached high accuracy on validation datasets, confirming its ability to remember conversation context effectively.

### GPT-3/4 Response Generation

- The fine-tuned **GPT** model demonstrated coherent and contextually relevant responses in both training and testing, outperforming traditional retrieval-based chatbots.
- **Metrics**: Precision, Recall, and F1-Score were used to evaluate the responses, showing a marked improvement in understanding and generating coherent text.

## Results

### Sample Conversations

- **User**: "What payment methods are accepted?"
  - **Chatbot**: "We accept various payment methods, including Visa, MasterCard, American Express, and PayPal. Is there anything else I can help you with?"
- **User**: "Can I use Google Pay?"
  - **Chatbot**: "Yes, Google Pay is also accepted for all purchases. If you have further questions or need more information, feel free to ask."

These responses demonstrate the model’s ability to handle follow-up questions in a way that maintains context and relevance.

### Scalability Testing

The chatbot was tested on **AWS Kubernetes** to verify its scalability under heavy load, with 1000 concurrent requests. The response time was consistently low, with minimal latency, confirming that the system is production-ready for enterprise use.
